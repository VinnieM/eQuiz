Created this application in 2007, when I started learning Java.
The entire code was written using a notepad, at that time I was not aware of any editors.

To Run this code:
Firstly a JDBC-ODBC Connection needs to be created for SQL.
From the SQL folder, execute all the .sql files, starting with User_Ques_Result.sql
After that compile all the 3 java files, using the command prompt.
to run the code.
If the JDBC-ODBC connection is created successfully, then the login box would appear and you would be able to login successfuly.
