# eQuiz
Created this application back in 2007, when I started learning Java. The entire code was written using a notepad. Planning to make this code more robust.

To Run this code, firstly create a JDBC-ODBC connection for SQL (Make sure you test your connection). In your SQL Editior execute all the .sql files, starting with User_Ques_Result.sql. Compile all the 3 java files, using the command prompt to run the code. Execute the java file Quiz.java. If all the above steps goes well, then the login box would appear and you would be able to login successfuly.
